##### The disadvantage of old system.
Commerce on Internet often face disputes and need a trusted third party to mediate. It brings some disadvantage problem, such as added expense of financial institutions to resolve conflicts and the result of disputes rely on these financial insituations. Disputes can make reversal transactions, so both parties need be vigilant, especially merchants must be wary of their customer to avoid defraud.
#### Solution
